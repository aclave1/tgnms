# scan_service - Wireless Radio Scan Analysis + Storage
`scan_service` is a micro-service built on top of `tglib` that is responsible
for the collection and analysis of wireless radio scan data from Terragraph
networks.

## Architecture
The entry point to `scan_service` is an event handler that consumes messages
from Kafka and performs actions based on the message contents. The service
listens to the following Kafka topics:

- `events`: a stream of network events generated from many places within the
Terragraph ecosystem. `scan_service` performs actions on the `SCAN_COMPLETED`
event. This event is generated when a network finishes running a series of 
scans. `scan_service` performs analysis of the newly completed scans when it 
receives this event.

- `scan_results`: a stream of wireless scan data generated by running scans
between nodes, which contain information about signal strength, interference,
etc. This stream only contains one type of message, `ScanResultEventWrapper`,
which contains the results from scans that have finished on a network.
`scan_service` processes and stores this data inside of its own internally
managed scan database.

## Storage
The service stores scan data and analysis results inside of a MySQL database.
Each table it interacts with is defined by a file in `scan_service/models`.
The tables are defined as follows:

- `tx_scan_response`: Each row in this table represents the Scan results for 
scan token. It contains parameters used in the scan it ran and metadata about 
the group of scans it ran in.

- `scan_response_rate`: Each row in this table contains analysis data about
the response rate and error rate for a scan group (a series of scans of the
same type which were triggered from the same scheduling event).
